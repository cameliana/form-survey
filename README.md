# Survey Form for Responsive Web Design Certification

As the first project for the Responsive Web Design Certification, I developed a Survey Form that showcases my proficiency in creating user-friendly and visually appealing web interfaces.

The survey form is designed to collect user feedback effectively, incorporating clear labels, input fields, and radio buttons. A thoughtful layout and styling enhance the user experience, making it intuitive and accessible. This project serves as a foundational step in mastering responsive web design techniques, setting the stage for more complex challenges in the certification journey.
